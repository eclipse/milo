/**
 * Encodes and decodes dynamic values using the definitions in a DataType tree.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.core.types.codec.DynamicCodecFactory} selects a codec for
 * each definition. The encoding context supplies nested codecs, while the tree resolves field types
 * and their inherited builtin representation. Decoded values retain their DataType metadata so they
 * can later be encoded through the same context.
 *
 * <p>Subtype-enabled scalar, array, and matrix fields contain {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.stack.core.types.UaStructuredType} values. Nested codecs may return
 * generated Java values or dynamic structures, unions, and option sets; the fields preserve those
 * representations for subsequent encoding.
 *
 * <p>Structure definitions determine wire field order and optional-field mask positions. Omitting a
 * value does not change the position of any later optional field. Applications supply members by
 * name; codecs translate those members into the declared wire layout.
