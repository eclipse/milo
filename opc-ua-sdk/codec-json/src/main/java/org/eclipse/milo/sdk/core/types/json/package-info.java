/**
 * Represents dynamic OPC UA structures as JSON objects while preserving their declared wire types.
 *
 * <p>A DataType tree supplies field definitions and inheritance information. Codecs map JSON
 * members to those fields and use the encoding context for nested structured values. The JSON
 * object holds application data; the definition determines field order, optional-field mask
 * positions, and union selection when serializing through an OPC UA encoder.
 *
 * <p>Absent optional members remain absent after decoding and re-encoding. Their omission does not
 * move the mask bits assigned to later fields.
 *
 * <p>Codecs pass optional-field and union-member names in definition order to the decoder's
 * semantic header operations. This lets each encoding read numeric headers or recover presence and
 * selection from named members without introducing encoding-specific decisions into the codecs.
