/**
 * Converts OPC UA values between XML and the stack's Java value types.
 *
 * <p>Encoders and decoders use an encoding context for namespaces, limits, and structured-type
 * codecs. A decoder owns its XML cursor and should be used for one input at a time. Element
 * boundaries determine the value layout; indentation and comments between elements do not carry
 * values. Decoding skips non-element nodes at value boundaries without modifying the input DOM or
 * whitespace inside String and XmlElement payloads.
 *
 * <p>Variants identify their contained builtin type from the XML element name. Matrix decoding
 * validates dimensions, element types, and element counts for both Variants and directly decoded
 * matrices. Structured values are delegated to the codecs registered in the context.
 *
 * <p>Structures inside Variants are carried as ExtensionObjects. Null elements of typed structure
 * arrays and Matrices use an {@code xsi:nil} ExtensionObject element; they are not passed to a
 * structure codec. Decoding retains these positions as null-valued ExtensionObjects. Matrices
 * passed to the Variant encoder need explicit data type metadata when their first element cannot
 * identify the structure type.
